## **Introduction**

Bisner’s location-based access feature ensures that **members can only access meeting rooms and news feeds relevant to their designated location**. By setting or modifying members’ locations, you help maintain a seamless user experience and prevent unauthorised access to other areas.

## **Step-by-Step Guide:**

**1. Access the Members Module**

- Use the **Search** bar to find the member whose location you want to edit.

## **Additional Considerations**
