# **Step 1: Enabling Modules**

1. Begin by navigating to the **Modules** section. 

    1. Click on the settings cogwheel and click on modules
    2. Or go-to your-bisner-platform-domain/admin/modules
2. Here you can easily access all the modules that are available on your Bisner platform. You can either scroll through the whole list or select on specific categories like “**Integrations**” to access specific modules. 
    1. In case you want to setup or change any of the Integrations module, it’s advised to let it be done with the Bisner support team.
3. Make sure to enable all applicable modules required for your setup, such as the Events module. Any inactive module will show '**Activate**'—just click on it to activate.
4. Once you’ve activated the relevant modules, refresh the page. Some modules will now be visible in the interface, although not all may display immediately. 
    1. Sometimes it can take some minutes, if the module doesn’t show up after some time even after following the below given navigation settings and also having proper permission to view the module, it is best to reach out to Bisner support.

# **Step 2: Configuring the Navigation Menu**

The following steps give you a quick overview on how to configure your navigation menu.

1. After activating the modules, go to the **Navigation Manager** through the platform settings menu.
2. Here you can manage the navigation options, to ensure that each module appears in the platform's menu.
3. On the left side, you’ll see a list of available menu items. Expand the sections as needed. 
4. Then to place a new menu item in your navigation, follow these steps:
    1. Select any of the menu item options within the modules on the left. for initial setup, use the primary option (usually the top one) for all modules to ensure consistency.
    2. Click and drag it to the right plane and drop it at the location where you want it to be shown in the menu.
    3. Click on the three dots to access the options for your new menu item and select **manage settings**.
    4. Configure the settings for your menu item. Consider the following:
        (i) **Name**: The label that will be displayed to users.
        (ii) **Visibility**: Restrict visibility to specific user roles if needed.
        (iii) **Platform Availability**: Enable the menu item for web, mobile, or both.
        (iv) Save the settings of your menu item
5. Once items are added, **save your changes**. Make sure each new module is visible on both web and mobile platforms.

**Note:** Saving applies only at the end of this process. However, each menu item's individual settings should be configured and saved separately.

# **Step 3: Verifying Roles & Permissions**

1. Next, review the **Roles & Restrictions** settings. You can get here through the platform settings menu.
2. Confirm that the **Admin** role has full access to all new modules. For this initial setup, configuring permissions for other roles is not necessary. 
3. Sometimes, when new modules are enabled, permissions for the Admin role are not granted by default. Ensure these permissions are enabled to make the modules accessible in the navigation.

# **Summary**

To establish the basic structure, complete these three checks:

1. Activate required modules.
2. Configure and manage the Navigation Menu.
3. Confirm Admin permissions for all new modules.

Following these steps will ensure a smooth setup for the platform's foundational structure.

# How to Configure Roles and Permissions

## Introduction

Managing user roles and permissions ensures that members have the right level of access to platform features. This is one of the most important functionalities available in our platform, as it allows you to control how different groups interact within your community and define what they can do.

For example, you might want to:

- Give **regular tenants** full access to shared spaces and community features.
- Offer **premium members** additional perks or exclusive permissions.
- Limit access for **freelancers or external visitors** to only specific areas.
- Control what **public users** can see and do within the platform.

This guide walks you through the process of creating new roles, assigning permissions, and ensuring that each role has the necessary access rights.

By following these steps, you can easily configure roles in the admin panel and maintain a structured permission system tailored to your needs.

## 1. Accessing Role Settings

To begin, navigate to the **Admin Panel** and follow these steps:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Platform Settings** > **Roles & Restrictions**.

2. Here, you’ll see a list of roles on the left and a list of permissions that can be assigned to each role.
3. By default, we provide a set of standard roles: **Admin, Guest, Public Access, and User** roles.

1. Click the **plus (+) button** to add a new role.
2. Enter a name for the role (you can copy and paste it if needed).
3. Click **Create** to finalise the role.

> Note: After creating a new role, it may not immediately appear in the list. Simply refresh the page if needed.

## 3. Assigning Permissions to a Role

Once the role is created, you can assign the necessary permissions:

1. Locate the new role in the list.
2. Assign the required permissions by selecting them from the available options.
3. Review the selected permissions to confirm they match the required access level.
4. Click **Save** to apply the changes.

---

## 4. Additional Considerations

- If you have trouble finding a specific permission, you can use the **Ctrl + F** (Windows) or **Command + F** (Mac) shortcut to search for keywords within the permissions list.
- Double-check that all necessary permissions are enabled before saving.

# Roles and Permissions Guide

## Introduction

Manage control over platform access for your Bisner platform users by efficiently managing user roles and permissions in Bisner. Users can be assigned multiple roles. This guide walks you through the essentials to create, manage, and customise roles to fit your platform’s needs.

# Accessing Roles and Permissions

- Hover over the **cogwheel icon** at the top of your screen.
- Hover over **Platform Settings**, then select **Roles & Restrictions**.

# **Review Role Permissions**

- This page displays all roles and any restrictions for active modules within the platform.
- Customise permissions for each role and module by ticking checkboxes in the relevant rows for each restriction.

# Managing Roles

## **View Existing Roles**

- From the left-hand menu, click **Roles** to see an overview of all current roles within the platform. It also displays the count of members per role.


## **Add a New Role**

- Click the **(+) icon** on the left-hand menu to create a new role.
- Enter the role name in the designated field and select **Create**.


## **Edit a Role**

- Select the already existing role, it will show a textbox where you can rename the role by typing a new name, and click **Save** to update the role.


## **Delete a Role**

- Hover over the **cogwheel icon** next to the role name to find the delete option.
- Click **Delete Role** to remove the role from the platform.

# Setting Default Roles

- Go to **Settings** in the left-hand menu to see the default roles that you can assign to invited members and registered members.

- **Invited Members' Default Role**
    - This setting is to assign default role for members who are invited to the platform. This is usually done by the Admin or the Company Owner.
    - Here you can use the dropdown to select one of the available roles.
- **Registered Members' Default Role**
    - This setting is to assign default role for members register themselves through the landing page of your platform.
    - Also here you can use the dropdown to select one of the available roles.
- Click **Save** to finalise settings.

# Tips

- Remember that users can be assigned many roles, so having distinguished roles for specific permissions can give you good flexibility to organise different access for your team members.
- DO NOT give too many team members the main Admin role. Only a few team members in your organisation should have this.
- When your organisation has many different locations that require multiple layers of flexibility, then it’s better to have multiple similar roles. You can then put the location name into the name of the role like for:
    - Hosts for different locations, for
        - LocA - host
        - LocB - host
        - LocC - host
    - Similarly you can setup permissions for different membership types for different locations that only support it, for example:
        - Member Type 1
            - LocA - member type 1
            - LocB - member type 1
            - LocC - member type 1
        - Member Type 2
            - LocA - member type 2
            - LocC - member type 2
- Having more specific roles with specific permission sets provides you more flexibility and granularity to organise access on your Bisner platform. However this will also lead to more time to apply the right permission checkboxes.
