# Ella (Effortless Learning & Lookup Assistant)

Ella is an AI agent that helps you automatically transforms your teamâ€™s resolved chat threads into a living FAQ document so no question has to be answered twice.

## 60-Second Pitch
- âš¡ **Instant answers**: Ella searches its Knowledge Base built on historical conversations and replies in real time.
- ðŸ™‹ **Escalates smartly**: No answer? Ella posts the question to **#faq** channel so teammates can jump in.
- ðŸ§  **Self-learning**: Once solved, Ella stores the new Q&A, eliminating repeat questions.
