# Ella (Effortless Learning & Lookup Assistant)

Ella is an AI agent that helps you automatically transforms your team‚Äôs resolved chat threads into a living FAQ document so no question has to be answered twice.

## 60-Second Pitch

- ‚ö° **Instant answers**: Ella searches its Knowledge Base built on historical conversations and replies in real time.
- üôã **Escalates smartly**: No answer? Ella posts the question to **#faq** channel so teammates can jump in.
- üß† **Self-learning**: Once solved, Ella stores the new Q&A, eliminating repeat questions.

- **Read Agent** forwards the question to Vertex AI (Gemini + RAG).
- Vertex AI pulls relevant documents from a Cloud Storage corpus, combines them with the LLM, and returns an answer.
- FastAPI delivers Ella‚Äôs reply back.
- If the user (or teammate) runs `/add_doc`, the **Write & Curate Agent** stores the new document in Cloud Storage, expanding the corpus that RAG searches next time.
