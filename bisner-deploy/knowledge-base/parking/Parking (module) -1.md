# Bisner License Plate Management and Brivo Sync

Section: Admin

## Introduction

Bisner’s License Plate Management feature integrates seamlessly with Brivo to sync license plate information, offering a more efficient and user-friendly experience. When combined with Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) cameras, this feature allows for smooth entry and exit from parking areas. Users benefit from an enhanced UX, as they no longer need to stop their vehicle. Instead, they can simply approach the gate at a low speed, and it will open automatically. This streamlined process provides convenience and speed, making access easier for all users.

Brivo's system supports a wide range of license plate formats, including those commonly used in the Netherlands and other European countries. It accommodates various alphanumeric combinations, ensuring broad compatibility across different regions. With proper configuration, this ensures that vehicle access remains efficient and accurate.

This guide will walk you through the key aspects of the feature, helping you understand how it works and how to use it effectively.

### **1. Preparing for the Sync**

Before enabling Brivo License Plate Management, it’s essential to understand how the synchronisation process works and what needs to be set up:

- **Synchronization Activation**: **Turning this feature on or off will sync respectively unsync all users' license plates with Brivo**. Keep in mind that this process can take some time.
- **User Input**: Users have the ability to add their own license plates. Once added, these will automatically sync with Brivo.

### **2. Rules Related to License Plates**

To ensure successful synchronisation, several rules must be adhered to:

- **Formatting**: Special characters are automatically removed, and letters are capitalised when syncing license plates to Brivo.
- **Character Limit**: License plates with more than 11 characters will not be synced.
- **Duplicate Handling**: If duplicates exist in Brivo, only the first license plate added will be synced.
- **Legacy Plates**: License plates added before the integration with Brivo may not be synced if they don't meet the character limit or special symbol requirements.

### **3. How the Sync Works**

Understanding the synchronisation process is crucial for effective management:

- **Automatic Checks**: Bisner automatically checks each user synced with Brivo to see if they have a license plate associated with their profile. If a valid license plate is found, it is synced to Brivo and saved in Bisner’s database.
- **Verification**: A table is provided to track logins and ensure accurate synchronisation with Brivo, allowing you to verify if license plates have been added correctly.

### **4. Changes After a Sync**

Post-sync modifications may require additional actions:

- **Deletion**: Deleting a license plate for a user will trigger a resynchronisation of all license plates for that user.
- **Manual Removal**: Removing a license plate in Brivo can break the mapping with Bisner. In such cases, you may need to remove and re-add the license plate on the Bisner platform for the specific user.

By understanding these guidelines, you can effectively manage license plate information within Bisner and ensure seamless integration with Brivo.
