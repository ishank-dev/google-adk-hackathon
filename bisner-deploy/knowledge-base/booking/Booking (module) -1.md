---

## **Step-by-Step Guide:**

**1. Access Integration Settings**

- [**Accessing Modules in Bisner.**](https://curly-site-546150.framer.app/docs/accessing-modules-in-bisner)

---

## **Using Microsoft Teams Meetings in Reservations**

Once **online meetings** are enabled, any reservation for a room linked to Outlook automatically includes:

- A **direct link** for participants to join the meeting.

---

## **Known Issue**

You can **add text** in the reservation description. However, it is currently **not possible to remove** the description entirely once set—though descriptions can be updated.

This restriction prevents users from removing the online meeting details (which would disable the online meeting setting).

---

## **About Using Teams Devices**

To **automatically connect** Teams devices with the online meeting, you need a **Microsoft Teams Rooms Pro** licence.

---

By enabling Microsoft Teams Online Meetings in Bisner, you can:

# Bookable Days Settings

### Accessing the Admin Panel

- Start by locating the Settings icon at the top right of the Bisner platform.

### Configuring Bookable Days Settings

- **Book Ahead**
    - This feature allows you to set the maximum number of days users can book in advance from the current date.
        - For example, if people can book meeting rooms too far in advance, you might have rooms that are reserved but then not used. By allowing bookings only up to 7 days ahead, you can reduce empty slots and make sure that spaces are used more often.
    - You can also determine which roles have access to this feature.
        - Only the enabled roles will have this restriction.
        - Any disabled role can book meeting rooms freely in the future.
    - If all roles are disabled, even with the **Number of days** set, anyone can still book freely in the future.

- **Block Bookable Days**
    - Use this feature to block specific days when the room should not be bookable.
    - By adding date ranges, the room will be blocked and unavailable on the specified dates.
    - Alternatively, if you enable the option **“Room is bookable on specified date ranges,”** the room will only be available for booking on those selected dates.

After configuring the settings as needed, don't forget to save your configuration to ensure all changes are applied.

# Credit Management System in Bisner

Section: Admin

Efficient resource allocation is crucial for smooth operations. Bisner continually enhances its features to meet the evolving needs of modern businesses. One such enhancement is the revamped credit management system, which allows admins to configure credit costs per hour, per room, and per role.

### Understanding the Upgrade

- Previously, every user spent one credit per hour for any room booked.
- With the latest update, admins can now set:
    - Credit cost per hour
    - Per room
    - Based on specific member roles
- This provides more flexibility in managing costs and room usage.

### Enabling Credit Limits

To activate credit limits in Bisner:

1. Navigate to the **Admin Panel**.
2. Select the **Modules** tab > choose **Booking**.
3. Go to **Settings** > **Booking Credits** section.
4. Toggle **Enable Credit Limits** on.
5. Set the number of credits per role (can be decimals e.g., 0.25, 0.75, 1.35).
6. Save changes at the bottom of the page.

### Configuring Room Settings

Once credit limits are enabled:

1. In **Admin Panel** > **Modules** > **Booking** > **Settings** > select **Meeting Rooms**.
2. Choose the desired room.
3. In the **Settings** page, toggle on **Enable Paid Booking**.
4. Scroll to **Credits per Hour** and set rates per role.
5. Save your changes.

> **Note:** By default, rooms with credit pricing enabled charge 1 credit/hour unless configured otherwise.

### Understanding Different Scenarios

- **Rooms with Only Credit Usage**
    - If **Enable Paid Booking** is off, users must have sufficient credits to book.
- **Rooms with Both Credits and Paid Booking**
    - With **Enable Paid Booking** on, users can pay after their credits run out.
- **Rooms for Paid Reservations Only**
    - Turn on **Disable Reservations with Credits** to only allow paid bookings.

### Understanding Pricing Logic

- If a member has multiple roles, the system charges the **lowest credit rate** available to them.
    - Example: Guest role = 2 credits/hour, User role = 1 credit/hour → User is charged 1 credit/hour.
