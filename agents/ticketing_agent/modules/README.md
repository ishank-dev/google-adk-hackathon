The bot uses AI to evaluate content before adding it to the knowledge base:

- **Score 60-100**: Content is automatically added
- **Score 0-59**: Content is rejected with explanation
- **Use `force`**: Skip checking entirely

When used in threads, the bot captures:

- ‚úÖ All messages in the conversation
- ‚úÖ Participant names and timestamps
- ‚úÖ Complete discussion context
- ‚úÖ Any additional context you provide

### **Visual Feedback**

The bot provides immediate feedback through reactions:

- ‚è≥ `hourglass_flowing_sand` - Processing
- ‚úÖ `white_check_mark` - Successfully added
- üö´ `no_entry_sign` - Content rejected
- ‚ùå `x` - Error occurred
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `warning` - Invalid command format

## üìÅ **Category Organization**

Organize your knowledge base with categories:

**Common Categories:**

- `processes` - Workflows and procedures
- `documentation` - Technical docs and guides
- `meetings` - Meeting notes and decisions
- `troubleshooting` - Problem-solving guides
- `policies` - Company policies and rules
- `team_updates` - Team announcements
- `general` - Default category for misc content

---

## üîß **Advanced Usage**

### **Thread Capture Best Practices**

1. **End of Discussion**: Use the command after a meaningful discussion concludes
2. **Clear Titles**: Use descriptive titles that others can search for
3. **Proper Categories**: Choose relevant categories for better organization
4. **Additional Context**: Add context to explain the thread's importance

### **Content Guidelines**

The AI checks for:

- **Informational Value**: Does it help team members?
- **Work Relevance**: Is it related to work/processes/tools?
- **Completeness**: Is the information useful as-is?
- **Clarity**: Is it understandable?
- **Appropriateness**: Is it suitable for a professional knowledge base?

### **When to Use Force**

Use the `force` option when:

- Content is relevant but might score low
- Saving personal notes or reminders
- Capturing incomplete but important discussions
- Override AI decisions you disagree with

---

## üö® **Troubleshooting**

### **Command Not Working?**

1. Make sure you're mentioning the bot correctly: `@ella`
2. Check command spelling: `add_doc` (with underscore)
3. Use quotes around titles/categories: `title="My Title"`
4. Try the test command: `@ella test`

### **No Response?**

1. Check if bot has necessary permissions
2. Verify you're in a channel where the bot is present
3. Try a simple slash command first: `/document_stats`

### **Content Rejected?**

1. Add more context to make it more relevant
2. Use the `force` option if you believe it's important
3. Check the relevance score and feedback provided
